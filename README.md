# Design Patterns in Java

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating various design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers, offering solutions to common problems in software design.

## Introduction

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Reusing design patterns helps prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders who are familiar with the patterns.

## Patterns Covered

1. **Creational Patterns**
    - Singleton
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Prototype
    - Builder

2. **Structural Patterns**
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
    - Strategy
    - Command
    - Observer
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - State
    - Visitor
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Interpreter
    - Template Method

## Directory Structure

Each design pattern is organized in its own package under the corresponding pattern type directory:

```
- src
  - creational
    - singleton
    - factorymethod
    - ...
  - structural
    - adapter
    - ...
  - behavioral
    - strategy
    - ...
```

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the specific design pattern directory you wish to explore.
3. Compile and run the Java files as necessary. Each pattern includes its own `Main.java` demonstrating the pattern in action.

## Contributions

Contributions in the form of new design patterns, improvements to existing patterns, or even documentation enhancements are welcome!

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-pattern`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some pattern'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-new-pattern`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
